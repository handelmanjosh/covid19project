# covid19project
stochastic simulation designed to test the spread of COVID-19 through a school-like environment

This was done in two weeks as my earlier project with my mentor over the summer fell through. Some parts aren't that pythony because I learned python as I was doing the project

The added file, vaxmask0to.py, is a variation of the simulation testing the effect of masking with an effectivity of 10% to 40%, and vaccination of 20 to 80 people per day.
